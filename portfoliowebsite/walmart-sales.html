					<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
					<p>The dataset was obtained from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting">Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition</a>. This dataset contains sales transactions from a three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows.
</p>

					<h2><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
					<p>The major aim of thie project is to gain insight into the sales data of Walmart to understand the different factors that affect sales of the different branches.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Task</strong></h2>
					<p><ol><li>Product Analysis: Conduct analysis on the data to understand the different product lines, the products lines performing best and the product lines that need to be improved.</li>
					<li>Sales Analysis: This analysis aims to answer the question of the sales trends of product. The result of this can help use measure the effectiveness of each sales strategy the business applies and what modificatoins are needed to gain more sales.</li>
					<li>Customer Analysis: This analysis aims to uncover the different customers segments, purchase trends and the profitability of each customer segment.</li>

				</ol>	
				</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Action</strong></h2>
					<p>Data Wrangling: This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure <strong>NULL</strong> values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace, missing or <strong>NULL</strong> values.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Build a database
						</li>
						<li>
							Create table and insert the data.
						</li>
						<li>
							Select columns with null values in them.
							<p>There are no null values in our database as in creating the tables, we set <strong>NOT NULL</strong> for each field, hence null values are filtered out.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				
					Feature Engineering: This will help us generate some new columns from existing ones.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Add a new column named <code>time_of_day</code>
							<p>To give insight into sales in the Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Add a new column named <code>day_name</code>
							<p>That contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Add a new column named <code>month_name</code>
							<p>That contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). This will help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
