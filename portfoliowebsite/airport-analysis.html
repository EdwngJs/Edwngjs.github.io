					<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
					<p>For this project, I used an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/airlines-dataset">airline database</a> from Kaggle.
						The dataset includes multiple tables from a SQL database contains the aircraft and airport data, bookings, flights, boarding passes, etc. For this project, I used the tables that contain the flight, airport and ticket data. </p>

					<h2><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
					<p>The objective of this project was to utilize SQL and Python for data retrieval, transformation, cleaning, and analysis of flight data. The primary goals were to identify causes of flight delays and explore correlations, as well as to analyze the revenues generated from these flights.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Task</strong></h2>
					<p><ol><li>Retrieve the flight data from the database using SQL queries.</li>
					<li>Load the retrieved data into Python as a pandas dataframe for data transformation and cleaning.</li>
					<li>Analyze the cleaned data to identify causes of flight delays and explore correlations between different variables.</li>
					<li>Analyze the revenue data associated with the flights.</li>
				</ol>	
				</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Action</strong></h2>
					<p>Data Retrieval: Utilized SQL queries to extract the flight data from the database, including information such as flights, departure and arrival times and airports, and ticket sales.</p>
					Data Transformation and Cleaning: Loaded the retrieved data into Python and performed necessary transformations and cleaning procedures to ensure data quality and consistency. This involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, perform required calculations and merging datasets.</p>
					Analysis for Flight Delays: Analyzed the cleaned data to identify patterns and factors contributing to flight delays. This involve exploring other variables such as airport outbounds and distance between airports</p>
					Correlation Analysis: Explored correlations between arrival and departure delays to understand relationships and potential factors influencing flight delays. </p>
					Revenue Analysis: Analyzed the revenue data associated with the flights to identify revenue trends and profitability of different routes and distances.</p>
					<p>Coding is <a href="https://github.com/EdwngJs/Airline-Dataset-Analysis/blob/main/Airlines%20analysis.ipynb">available here</a></p>
				</p>

					<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
					<p><li>Explore causes of flight delays.</li>
					<li>Explored correlations between various factors, providing insights into how different variables may influence flight delays.</li>
					<li>Analyzed the revenue data to understand the factors that impact the ticket prices.</li>
					</p>

					<h2><strong>Key Takeways / Lessons learned</strong></h2>
					<p><li>Utilizing SQL and Python together allows for comprehensive data analysis and insights generation.</li>
					<li>Using Python to write SQL queries can save you time. It is a good tool (when applicable) for your workflow.</li>
					<li>With this project I could perform a lot of data cleaning and manipulation to string data and also json objects.</li>
					<li>Write functions to calculate statistics parameters and flight distances using the given coordinates.</li>
					<li>If I were to work with this project I would explore other factors that could impact the flight delays and determine actions for the potential root causes.</li>
