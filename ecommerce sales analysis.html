					<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
					<p>This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. 
					 The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data">dataset</a> is available on Kaggle.
					

					<h2><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
					<p>The main goal in this project is to perform some exploratory data analysis, answer some business questions and create a sales report in Power BI.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Task</strong></h2>
					<p><ol><li>Exploring the dataset.</li>
					<li>Perform data transformation for further analysis.</li>
					<li>Answer business questions using the data.
					<li>Create a dashboard with the following:</li>	<ul><li> KPI Tiles for total revenue, number of transactions, and number of unique customers.
<li>Bar Charts to display top-selling products and top customers by revenue.
<li>Line Charts for monthly sales trends over time.
<li>Map Visualization showing sales distribution by country.
<li>Scatter Plot showing average order value vs. number of orders for each customer.
<li>Pie chart of refunded transactions vs. successful transactions.</li></ul>

					<h2><strong>Action</strong></h2>

					<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
					<p>

At first glance, we observed the following anomalies:
<li>Unusual quantities (-80995.0 , 80995.0) and unit prices (-11062.06, 0, 38970.0) values.
<li>Inconsistency in Stockcodes (DOT, POST)
<li>Missing CustomerIDs.
<li>Different / missing descriptions for same StockCode.
<li>Weird transactions for CustomerID 15098. However, most of these seem to be caused by entry errors and new records were created to adjust them. Negative quantity values could be a 'return transaction' in which the item was returned. We could go deeper to identify more anomalies but let's keep it simple. Therefore, those records with null values could be deleted for the analysis.

	<h4>What is the average order value?</h4>
	20.40
<p>
	<h4>Are there seasonal trends in customer purchases? For example, do customers buy more during the holiday season?</h4>
	There is not a strong trend to determine whether customers purchase more on Holiday season. However, Q4 has the highest revenue. The month with more transactions is November '21.
<p>
	<h4>Which products generate the most revenue, and which are the least profitable?</h4>
	The stock codes '22423' and '85123A' generate the most revenue whilst codes '79323W' and '22769' the least. We should check the reason why it is generating losses to the company.
<p>
	<h4>What is the distribution of product prices, and how does it impact sales volume?</h4>
Lower cost products (USD$ 1.25 - 3.75) sell the most. Low prices is likely to be a decisive factor of acquiring a product. Products with prices above USD$10 have less than 10k unit solds per year.

There are products that have a price of USD$0 (Free). It would be interesting to know the reason behind this since there are many high volume transactions as Free.
<p>
	<h4>How do monthly revenues compare? Are there specific months with a spike or drop in sales?</h4>
	Sales volume tends to increase over time. April has the lowest revenue recorded whilst November the highest. Seems that during Q4 sales increase due to Winter / Holiday season.
<p>
	<h4>What is the total sales revenue for the company during the dataset's timeframe?</h4>
	$8,300,065.81
<p>	
	<h4>How does sales performance vary across countries?</h4>
	United Kingdom has the most amount of transactions (sales).
<p>
	<h4>Identify patterns in transaction dates and times to determine the busiest sales periods.</h4>
	The busiest day of the week is Thursday. 12 - 1 PM seems to be the busiest hours.
