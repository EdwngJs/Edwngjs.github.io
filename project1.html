					<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
					<p>Example</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Situation</strong></h2>
					<p>The goal of this project was to analyze the performance of Formula 1 drivers using data analysis tools. The project was conducted during the 2021 Formula 1 season.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Task</strong></h2>
					<p>As part of a team of data analysts, my role was to develop a methodology for analyzing driver performance and to implement this methodology using Python and Tableau.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Action</strong></h2>
					<p>We began by collecting data on driver performance during the season, including lap times, qualifying positions, and race results. We then used Python to clean and process this data, calculating various metrics such as average lap time and consistency. We also used Tableau to visualize and explore the data, identifying trends and patterns in driver performance. 
					Here is the <a href="#">Python code</a> used to calculate driver consistency.</p>

					<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
					<p>Our analysis revealed several insights into driver performance, including the identification of drivers who were consistently fast and drivers who were prone to errors. We were able to use these insights to provide recommendations to the team's management on driver selection and strategy.
					Quantifiable results include:
					<li>Improved team performance through better driver selection.
					<li>Improved driver performance through targeted training and strategy adjustments
					<li>Improved team morale through increased confidence in driver performance</li></p>
					
					<h2><strong>Key takeways</strong></h2>
					<p>Through this project, I learned the importance of data-driven decision making in the world of Formula 1. I also gained valuable experience in using Python and Tableau for data analysis and visualization.
					If I were to do this project again, I would focus on incorporating more data sources, such as weather and track conditions, to gain a more complete understanding of driver performance.					
					For anyone interested in conducting a similar project, my advice would be to ensure you have a deep understanding of the domain and to be comfortable with data analysis tools such as Python and Tableau.</p>
