					<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
					<p>Dataset was obtained from the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">Federal Reserve Economic Data</a> and retrieved using Fred API in Python. Two (2) data sets were used for this analysis:</p>
					<li>Unemployment rate: The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. Labor force data are restricted to people 16 years of age and older, who currently reside in 1 of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, who do not reside in institutions (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.
					<li>Participation rate: The Labor Force Participation Rate is defined by the Current Population Survey (CPS) as “the number of people in the labor force as a percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population. Therefore, the participation rate is the percentage of the population that is either working or actively looking for work.”</p>

					<h2><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
					<p>The goal of this project was to analyze the unemployment rate versus the participation rate across the U.S. States and get insights such as tendency and behavior over the years.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Task</strong></h2>
					<p>As part of this project, my role was to retrieve the data using the website API (and its functions) and manipulate the data to develop a methodology for analyzing using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib and plotly express.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Action</strong></h2>
					<p>I began by collecting data using the FRED API functions, the data included the unemployment rate and participation rate across different categories. Then, I performed data manipulation to organize and clean the results from the queries. I also used Python libraries (matplotlib and plotly) to plot, visualize and explore the data, identifying trends and patterns in the unemployment and participation rates. 
					Here is the <a href="https://github.com/EdwngJs/UnemploymentRateAnalysis/blob/main/Economic%20Analysis.ipynb">Python code</a>.</p>

					<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
					<p>Our analysis revealed several insights into unemployement and participation performance, including the identification of trends (i.e. participation rate is decreasing over the years) and the behavior of the unemployment rate during recessions or global conflicts. These rates behavior is pretty similar across all the states.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Key takeways</strong></h2>
					<p>Through this project, I learned how to retrieve data using APIs. I also gained valuable experience in using Python for data analysis and visualization.
					If I were to do this project again, I would focus on incorporating more data sources and analysis, find correlation and causality to gain a more complete understanding of the unemployement rate.					
					For anyone interested in conducting a similar project, my advice would be to ensure you have a deep understanding of the domain and to be comfortable with data analysis tools such as Python.</p>
