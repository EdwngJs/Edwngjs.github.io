					<h2><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
					<p> Be able to use different window functions to retrieve the desired result from a database. In this project, I learned how to use SQL window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE(), and LAST_VALUE() to manipulate data in the database. Also, it considers how to use aggregate window functions. These window functions are used together with the OVER() clause to query this database. By extension, I used grouping functions like GROUPING SETS(), ROLLUP(), and CUBE() to retrieve sublevel and grand totals.</p>
					
					<h2><strong>Task</strong></h2>
					<p><ol><li>Understand how SQL window functions work and how to use them.</li>
					<li>Manipulate data in tables using SQL SELECT statements together with window functions.</li>
					<li>Use different SQL windows to get database insights.</li>
				</ol>	
				</p>

-- In this task, we will get started with the project
-- by retrieving all the data in the projectdb database
#############################

-- 1.1: Retrieve all the data in the projectdb database
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM departments;
SELECT * FROM regions;
SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM sales;

#############################
-- Task Two: Window Functions - Refresher
-- In this task, we will refresh our understanding
-- of using window functions in SQL
#############################

-- 2.1: Retrieve a list of employee_id, first_name, hire_date, 
-- and department of all employees ordered by the hire date
SELECT employee_id, first_name, department, hire_date,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS Row_N
FROM employees;

-- 2.2: Retrieve the employee_id, first_name, 
-- hire_date of employees for different departments
SELECT employee_id, first_name, department, hire_date,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date) AS Row_N
FROM employees;

#############################
-- Task Three: Ranking
-- In this task, we will learn how to rank the
-- rows of a result set
#############################

-- 3.1: Recall the use of ROW_NUMBER()
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY department
				  ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees;

-- 3.2: Let's use the RANK() function
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department
				  ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees;


-- Exercise 3.1: Retrieve the hire_date. Return details of
-- employees hired on or before 31st Dec, 2005 and are in
-- First Aid, Movies and Computers departments 
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary, hire_date,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department
			ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date <= '2005-12-31' AND department IN ('First Aid', 'Movies', 'Computers');

-- This returns how many employees are in each department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) dept_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY dept_count DESC;

-- 3.3: Return the fifth ranked salary for each department
SELECT * FROM (SELECT department, salary, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS salrank FROM employees) AS ranking
WHERE salrank = 5

-- Create a common table expression to retrieve the customer_id, 
-- and how many times the customer has purchased from the mall 
WITH purchase_count AS (
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(sales) AS purchase
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY purchase DESC
)

-- 3.4: Understand the difference between ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
SELECT customer_id, purchase,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY purchase DESC) AS Row_N,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY purchase DESC) AS Rank_N,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY purchase DESC) AS Dense_Rank_N

ORDER BY purchase DESC;

#############################
-- Task Four: Paging: NTILE()
-- In this task, we will learn how break/page
-- the result set into groups
#############################

-- 4.1: Group the employees table into five groups
-- based on the order of their salaries
SELECT salary, NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) FROM employees;

-- 4.2: Group the employees table into five groups for 
-- each department based on the order of their salaries
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary,
NTILE(5) OVER(PARTITION BY department
			  ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees;

-- Create a CTE that returns details of an employee
-- and group the employees into five groups
-- based on the order of their salaries
WITH salary_ranks AS (
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary,
NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_of_salary
FROM employees)
